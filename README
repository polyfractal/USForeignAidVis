Greenbook Visualization
=======================

US Foreign Aid over time
------------------------

This is a simple project I made to learn [D3.js](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/), a visualization and graphing library designed for interactive graphs.
	
### Controls/Instructions:
- Left click and drag map to move, control-click and drag to zoom</li>
- Hover over countries to see name and aid for that year, click for detailed stats</li>
- Hover over bar graphs to see aid for that year, click to switch years</li>
- The slider controls the displayed year as well</li>


### Data sources:
- Greenbook data came from [USAID](http://gbk.eads.usaidallnet.gov/)</a>. </li>
- "Inflation-adjusted dollars" were calculated using historical Consumer Price Indicies (CPI), available from the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt).</li>
- The USAID adjusts for inflation with "GDP Chain Price Index", but I didn't notice that until I had finished implementing the CPI.</li>
